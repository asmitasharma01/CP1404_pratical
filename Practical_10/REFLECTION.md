Q1) Write some short but thoughtful comments about each of the following:

1.regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy
and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?

I believe the practical assignments for each week of the course took approximately
Four to five days to complete,if I say about whole pratical its might be tough as compare to CP1401
I initially had trouble correctly identifying and comprehending the logic in the code,
which had an impact on how effectively I worked as a whole.

2.regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
Reviewing code nd being analysing our classmate code is nice ,it gives us to know how the other
making there code and to understand where I am can correct adopt that method that he/she used
in our own method .


3.regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge
of the subject?
I think practice is more important ,even if we are incorrect some point I can see try to fixed that
at least I should know where is the mistake . As student coding meaning complication . So
I should say to boost learning and understanding ,I would specifically increase the
the number of multiple technique and prove them more interesting and those who want to really want
to learn more.
